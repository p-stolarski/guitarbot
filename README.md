# guitarbot
I am trying to make a bot that can play the game clone hero for me.
i abused chatgpt for 90% of this code.
my idea is that i give the script picture of the notes when they are overtop of the nub where you need to hit the botton and when the script recognizes "hey stupid this png looks identical too the game" it presses the key corrisponding and strums at the same time. 
It shows the screenshots and proves it sees the notes. the goal now is to make it press the bottons when the notes are in the right spot and to also diffrentiate color.
here is the link to download the game https://clonehero.net/
