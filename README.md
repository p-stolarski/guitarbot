# guitarbot
I am trying to make a bot that can play the game clone hero for me.
i abused chatgpt for 90% of this code.
my idea is that i give the script picture of the notes when they are overtop of the nub where you need to hit the botton and when the script recognizes "hey stupid this png looks identical too the game" it presses the key corrisponding and strums at the same time. 
basically where my stupid ass is stuck right now is that it is throwing up errors saying something about not being able to read the pngs and i dont know why. feel free to take a crack for me.
here is the link to download the game https://clonehero.net/
